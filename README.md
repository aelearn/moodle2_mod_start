Moodle Plugins
=============

This repository is used to host all of our Moodle plugins that we've created.
Each plugin is stored in its own branch. The plugins should attempt to be named
in a standard way. The way I propose is:

moodle(1|2)_plugintype_name

If anyone has a better idea for naming these plugins please file a pull request
on this file.
